		From the grace and elegance, the city's canals and waterways embody the very spirit of 
		Amsterdam. They are spanned by many beautiful bridges, including the famous Magere Brug, 
		a traditionally stylled lift bridge. You can simply relax at a canalside caf√© and watch 
		an array of boats float by, or take a canal tour.
